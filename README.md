slideshow
=========

This is an extremely simple jquery plugin. To be able to use it you need to have jquery included on the page.

Installation
-------------
Clone this repository or just copy the code. Include both files on your page. Note that the javascript file needs to be included inside the <script> tag.
Set the height and width of your pictures in the css-file.

The html-page should look something like this, the id needs to be slideshow.
<div id='slideshow'>
<img src = 'img1'>
<img src = 'img2'>
<img src = 'img3'>
</div>

Here you can find an sample installation. http://www.student.bth.se/~frpe13/javascript/kmom03/slideshow.php

Best of luck!
