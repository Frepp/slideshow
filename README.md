slideshow
=========

This is an extremely simple jquery plugin. To be able to use it you need to have jquery included on the page.

Installation
-------------
Clone this repository or just copy the code. Include both files on your page. Note that the javascript file needs to be included inside the `<script>` tag.
Set the height and width of your pictures in the css-file.

The html-page should look something like this, the id needs to be slideshow.

```html
<div id='slideshow'>
<img src ='img1'>
<img src ='img2'>
<img src ='img3'>
...
</div>
```

[Here](http://www.student.bth.se/~frpe13/javascript/kmom03/slideshow.php) you can find a sample installation. 

Best of luck!
